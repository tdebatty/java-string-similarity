/**
 * Abstract class for string similarities that rely on set operations (like
 * cosine similarity or jaccard index).
 *
 * k-shingling is the operation of transforming a string (or text document) into
 * a set of n-grams, which can be used to measure the similarity between two
 * strings or documents.
 *
 * Generally speaking, a k-gram is any sequence of k tokens. We use here the
 * definition from Leskovec, Rajaraman & Ullman (2014), "Mining of Massive
 * Datasets", Cambridge University Press: Multiple subsequent spaces are
 * replaced by a single space, and a k-gram is a sequence of k characters.
 *
 * Default value of k is 3. A good rule of thumb is to imagine that there are
 * only 20 characters and estimate the number of k-shingles as 20^k. For small
 * documents like e-mails, k = 5 is a recommended value. For large documents,
 * such as research articles, k = 9 is considered a safe choice.
